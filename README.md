# Music-Genre-Classification
-----------------------------------
<h2>Problem Being Addressed</h2>
<p>Music genre classification is a fundamental task in music information retrieval that assists in
organizing vast amounts of music data, recommending systems, and music analysis. This project
utilizes the GTZAN dataset, which is popular for benchmarking classification models but also known
for its challenges like noise in genre labels and data integrity.</p>

<h2>Relevant Literature</h2>
<p>Several studies have used the GTZAN dataset for genre classification, employing various machine learning techniques:</p>
<ul>Tzanetakis and Cook (2002) introduced the GTZAN dataset in their foundational paper,
highlighting its use for feature extraction and genre classification.</ul>
<ul>Recent works have incorporated deep learning methods, notably Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), demonstrating significant
improvements in classification accuracy over traditional methods like Support Vector
Machines (SVMs) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).</ul>
